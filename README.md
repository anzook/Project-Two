Weclome to yappE!!

YappE is a project developed by Alex Zook, Phill Mitchell-Matsuyama, Mike Havrilak and Jody Jones.

YappE is an app for petowners to keep track of your pets daily, weekly, monthly or annual activities including walks, "bathroom" runs, feeding times, last checkups and so on.

As A Pet Owner
I want to know my pet's activities
So that I can share with my family the family pet's activities

For this app we utilized Node, mysql, sequelize, .env (in "developement"), javascript, jquery, Bulma for CSS and HTML.

The app starts on the landing page which prompts you to either Sign Up or Log In. Jquery sets up the automation for the responsiveness. Depending on whether you ar a New User signing up or an existing user logging in, the app will take you to two different pages. Sign Up takes you to the Initial Add page where you will be able to your pet's profile. Once added the app takes you to a Caretaker Add page in which you can add an additional caretaker who can log your pet's activities once in the Profile page. After you complete the Caretaker Add page the app take you to your pet's profile page where you will be able to log your pet's activities.
